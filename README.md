# salesforce-magic-package
Salesforce Magic Package (aka sfmagpkg or sfpkg) is a tool to generate a Salesforce package.xml from the Git svn.

The main idea behind this project is to don't care about your project package. Once you commit it in your branch, you can have all modified files in your package.
